### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
Know definition of align-items in flexbox.For aligned on the cross axis.
```css
.qrImage {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

If qrImage is nested inside other html element, Use width 100% means will control width of element depend on parent. And border-radius can make round around border.

### Continued development

I will practice more about frontend in topic html and css and framework like react.
